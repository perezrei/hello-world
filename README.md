# hello-world

## My name is Reinaldo Perez Vasquez

I am Venezuelan, married, I live with my wife and their two children here in Belgium I have a daughter too who lives in the United States. We arrived in the country 14 months ago fleeing from the political persecution of the Venezuelan dictatorship towards my family. At the end of October 2020, the Belgian government granted us political refugee status.

I am a Senior Marketing Technician and in the last 15 years I have worked in the area of printed advertising and lately in digital advertising. I have always liked technology. I have experience in creating websites through Adobe Muse, which is actually an interface to create them through graphic design and not codes and I have always felt that I had to prepare myself to work with code but I have let everyday circumstances not allow it.

I have never worked with code before so this assignment from Hack Your Future has allowed me to open my eyes to this wonderful world of web development.This is a golden opportunity for people who want to enter the world of web development and even more so for those like me who arrive in a new country full of opportunities like this one.

Next I will name some of the characteristics that define me as a worker:
* Curious
* Proactive
* Collaborator
* Extrovert
* Punctual

### I speak:

1. Spanish
2. English
3. French

### I have worked professionally with:

* Corel Draw
* Corel Photo Paint
* Adobe Muse
* Adobe In Design
* Microsoft Office

Since I decided to apply for this project I have visited many websites which have helped me to understand a little bit more what coding is. The one that I liked more is called [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com), maybe it would be useful if you, like me, are new in this world.

To end I would like to share a quote from one of the two founders of Apple.

>*"**Creativity** is just connecting things."*
-Steve Jobs
